    9.22 Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help an
elementary-school student learn multiplication. Use Math.random to produce two positive one-digit
integers. It should then display a question such as
How much is 6 times 7? 
The student then types the answer into a text field. Your program checks the student’s answer. If it’s
correct, display the string "Very good!" and generate a new question. If the answer is wrong, display
the string "No. Please try again." and let the student try the same question again repeatedly
until he or she finally gets it right.
9.23 The use of computers in education is referred to as computer-assisted instruction (CAI).
One problem that develops in CAI environments is student fatigue. This problem can be eliminated
by varying the computer's dialogue to hold the student's attention. Modify the program in
Exercise 9.22 to print one of a variety of comments for each correct answer and each incorrect answer.
The set of responses for correct answers is as follows:
Very good!
Excellent!
Nice work!
Keep up the good work!
The set of responses for incorrect answers is as follows:
No. Please try again.
Wrong. Try once more.
Don't give up!
No. Keep trying.
Use random number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select an
appropriate response to each answer. Use a switch statement to issue the responses.
9.24 More sophisticated computer-assisted instruction systems monitor the student’s performance
over a period of time. The decision to begin a new topic is often based on the student’s success
with previous topics. Modify the program in Exercise 9.23 to count the number of correct and
incorrect responses typed by the student. After the student answers 10 questions, your program
should calculate the percentage of correct responses. If the percentage is lower than 75 percent, display
Please ask your instructor for extra help, and reset the quiz so another student can try it.
